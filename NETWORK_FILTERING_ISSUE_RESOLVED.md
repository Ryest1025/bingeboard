# Network Filtering Issue - RESOLVED 

## Problem Summary
The network filtering was showing incorrect results where:
- Shows with multiple streaming platforms (like Breaking Bad with 8 platforms) would only show one platform when filtered
- Specifically, filtering by "Amazon Prime" would exclude shows that were actually available on Amazon platforms

## Root Cause Identified
The issue was **NOT** in the normalization logic as initially suspected, but in the **FilterControls component**:

1. **FilterControls.tsx** was using hardcoded network names like `'Amazon Prime'`
2. **Dashboard filtering logic** expected to match against actual TMDB provider names like `'Amazon Video'`, `'Prime Video'`
3. The `platformsMatch()` function correctly normalizes these, but `'Amazon Prime'` was not in the normalization mapping

## Files Fixed
- `/client/src/components/FilterControls.tsx`: Changed `'Amazon Prime'` to `'Amazon Prime Video'` in both dropdown menus

## Before Fix
```
FilterControls dropdown: "Amazon Prime" 
Dashboard filter tries to match: "Amazon Prime" vs ["Amazon Video", "Prime Video"]
platformsMatch("Amazon Prime", "Amazon Video") → false ❌
Result: Show excluded incorrectly
```

## After Fix  
```
FilterControls dropdown: "Amazon Prime Video"
Dashboard filter tries to match: "Amazon Prime Video" vs ["Amazon Video", "Prime Video"] 
platformsMatch("Amazon Prime Video", "Amazon Video") → true ✅
platformsMatch("Amazon Prime Video", "Prime Video") → true ✅
Result: Show included correctly
```

## Verification
- ✅ Platform normalization working: `"Amazon Prime Video"` → `"prime-video"`
- ✅ Platform matching working: `"Amazon Video"` → `"prime-video"` 
- ✅ Cross-matching working: `platformsMatch("Amazon Prime Video", "Amazon Video")` → `true`
- ✅ FilterControls updated to use correct names
- ✅ Multiple Amazon variants all normalize to same ID for matching

## Test Results
Breaking Bad with platforms `["Netflix", "Amazon Video", "Prime Video"]`:
- **Before**: Excluded when filtering by "Amazon Prime" 
- **After**: Included when filtering by "Amazon Prime Video" ✅

The normalization logic was actually working perfectly - the issue was the UI component using inconsistent network names.
