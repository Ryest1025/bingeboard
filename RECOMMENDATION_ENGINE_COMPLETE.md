- ✅ **Collaborative Filtering**: Finds users with similar taste and recommends their favorites  
- ✅ **Social Recommendations**: Leverages friend network activity
- ✅ **Trending Analysis**: Incorporates platform-wide popularity with personalization
- ✅ **Hybrid Algorithm**: Intelligently combines all approaches for optimal results

**2. Enhanced Database Schema** (`RECOMMENDATION_ENGINE_SCHEMA.md`)
- ✅ **user_behavior_events**: Granular user interaction tracking
- ✅ **content_features**: ML-ready content attributes
- ✅ **user_taste_profiles**: Dynamic preference modeling
- ✅ **content_embeddings**: Semantic similarity support
- ✅ **recommendation_candidates**: Scored recommendation storage
- ✅ **social_signals**: Friend network analysis
- ✅ **recommendation_experiments**: A/B testing framework
- ✅ **recommendation_feedback**: User response tracking

**3. Production-Ready API Endpoints**
```typescript
GET  /api/recommendations                    // Main personalized recommendations
GET  /api/recommendations/for-you           // Hybrid algorithm results
GET  /api/recommendations/social            // Friend-based recommendations  
GET  /api/recommendations/trending          // Personalized trending content
POST /api/recommendations/feedback          // User interaction tracking
GET  /api/recommendations/profile           // User taste profile
GET  /api/recommendations/explain/:id       // Detailed explanations
POST /api/recommendations/refresh           // Force refresh cache
```

## 📊 Next Steps

### 1. Database Migration
```bash
# Run the enhanced schema migration
./run-recommendation-migration.sh
```

### 2. Start Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 3. Test the Recommendation API
```bash
# Get recommendations for authenticated user
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
     http://localhost:5000/api/recommendations

# Get social recommendations  
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
     http://localhost:5000/api/recommendations/social

# Get user's taste profile
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
     http://localhost:5000/api/recommendations/profile
```

### 4. Frontend Integration Example
```typescript
// Frontend usage example
const recommendations = await fetch('/api/recommendations', {
  headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${userToken}` }
});

const { sections } = await recommendations.json();
// sections: [
//   { key: 'for_you', title: 'For You', items: [...] },
//   { key: 'friends_watching', title: 'Friends Are Watching', items: [...] },
//   { key: 'trending_now', title: 'Trending Now', items: [...] }
