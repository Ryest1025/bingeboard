- ✅ Better process management and error handling
- ✅ Automatic server health monitoring

## 🔧 **Code Quality Improvements**

### Type Safety
- ✅ Fixed all TypeScript errors
- ✅ Proper null checks for streaming platform data
- ✅ Consistent component prop interfaces

### Performance
- ✅ Enhanced `useMemo` dependencies for optimal re-rendering
- ✅ Better data processing with early returns
- ✅ Optimized filtering logic

### User Experience

## 🌐 **Current Server Status**

- **Frontend**: ✅ Running on http://localhost:3000/
- **Backend**: ✅ Running on http://localhost:5000/
- **API Connectivity**: ✅ Working properly
- **Streaming Data**: ✅ Loading with platform information

## 📋 **Server Stability Notes**

**Why servers were stopping:**
1. **Memory pressure** in dev containers
2. **Process management** issues with concurrent npm scripts
3. **Error propagation** causing cascading failures
4. **No automatic restart** mechanism

**Solutions implemented:**
1. **Monitoring script** that auto-restarts failed servers
2. **Robust startup** with health checks and dependencies
3. **Better error handling** preventing crashes
4. **Process tracking** and cleanup

## 🚀 **Ready for Use**

All suggested improvements have been implemented and tested. The discover page now has:

- ✅ Consistent `UniversalMediaCard` components
- ✅ Working platform filters for upcoming content
- ✅ Varied hero carousel content
- ✅ Robust error handling and loading states
- ✅ Server stability monitoring
- ✅ Enhanced user experience

**Usage:**
- Use `/scripts/start-dev-robust.sh` for reliable server startup
- Use `/scripts/monitor-servers.sh` for continuous monitoring
- Both servers should now be more stable and auto-recover from failures

The page is now production-ready with improved stability, better user experience, and all the suggested enhancements!
