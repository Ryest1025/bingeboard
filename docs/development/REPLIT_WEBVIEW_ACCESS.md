# Accessing BingeBoard in Replit Webview

## Current Status
âœ… **App is working perfectly!** 
- External URL: https://80d1bb7f-86b2-4c58-a8e0-62a1673122a3-00-2vv88inpi4v1.riker.replit.dev
- Server running on port 5000
- All React components loading correctly
- Vite development server functional

## Accessing in Replit Interface

### Method 1: Webview Tab
1. Look for a "Webview" tab in your Replit workspace
2. If not visible, click the "+" button to add a new tab
3. Select "Webview" from the available options
4. The webview should automatically detect port 5000

### Method 2: Run Button Preview
1. Click the "Run" button at the top of your Replit workspace
2. Look for a preview window or popup that appears
3. The preview should show your app running

### Method 3: Port 5000 Direct Access
1. In your Replit workspace, look for a "Ports" section
2. Click on port 5000 to open the preview
3. This will show the app in an embedded frame

### Method 4: Manual URL Override
If webview doesn't automatically detect:
1. Open webview tab
2. Manually enter: `https://80d1bb7f-86b2-4c58-a8e0-62a1673122a3-00-2vv88inpi4v1.riker.replit.dev`
3. Or use relative path: `localhost:5000`

## Expected Behavior
- Black loading screen with "BingeBoard" title appears first
- Then transitions to full React app
- All console logs show successful component loading
- Firebase authentication system ready for testing

## Next Steps
1. Access app through any of the above methods
2. Test Firebase authentication once domain is authorized
3. Deploy to Replit Deployments for custom domain SSL support
