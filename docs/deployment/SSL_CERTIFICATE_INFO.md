# SSL Certificate Setup

## Current Status
Getting "not secure" message is normal - SSL certificate is being generated.

## What's Happening
1. ✅ DNS routing works (domain points to Replit)
2. ✅ Server configured for www.joinbingeboard.com
3. ⏳ SSL certificate being generated by Replit (takes 5-15 minutes)

## Options

### Option 1: Wait for SSL (Recommended)
- SSL certificates take 5-15 minutes to generate
- Once ready, https://www.joinbingeboard.com will be fully secure
- No action needed, automatic process

### Option 2: Use HTTP for Testing
- Visit: http://www.joinbingeboard.com (no 's')
- Will work immediately without SSL
- Can test OAuth authentication now

### Option 3: Continue with Warning
- Click "Advanced" → "Proceed to www.joinbingeboard.com"
- Test app functionality while SSL generates

## Timeline
- DNS: ✅ Working
- Server: ✅ Configured  
- SSL: ⏳ 5-15 minutes
- OAuth: ✅ Ready once SSL completes

## Test Authentication
Once SSL is ready or using HTTP, test:
- Google login button
- Facebook login button
- Should work permanently without daily domain changes

The hard work is done - just waiting for SSL certificate generation!
