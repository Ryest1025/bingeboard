# IMMEDIATE: Add REPLIT_DOMAINS Environment Variable

## You Need to Add This Secret
Since REPLIT_DOMAINS is not in your Secrets tab, you need to add it:

1. **Go to Secrets tab** in your Replit project
2. **Click "New Secret"**
3. **Key**: `REPLIT_DOMAINS`
4. **Value**: `joinbingeboard.com`
5. **Click "Add Secret"**

## Why This is Critical
- Your app currently expects the old Replit domain
- The new custom domain won't work without this environment variable
- OAuth callbacks are configured based on this variable

## What Happens Next
1. Add the secret (1 minute)
2. Server will restart automatically
3. Wait 15 minutes for DNS propagation
4. Test: Visit https://joinbingeboard.com
5. Update OAuth URLs to use permanent domain

## Current Status
✅ DNS A record added in Wix
⏳ Need to add REPLIT_DOMAINS secret
⏳ Wait for DNS propagation
⏳ Test custom domain
⏳ Update OAuth callback URLs

This is the final step before permanent OAuth fix!
