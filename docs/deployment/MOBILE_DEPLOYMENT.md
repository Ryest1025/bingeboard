# BingeBoard Mobile App Deployment Guide

## App Store Configuration Summary

Your app is now configured for **App Store deployment** using a hybrid approach:

### ‚úÖ What's Been Set Up

1. **Capacitor Framework**: Native app wrapper with PWA capabilities
2. **App Configuration**: 
   - App ID: `com.bingeboard.app`
   - App Name: `BingeBoard`
   - Bundle identifier ready for App Store

3. **PWA Features**:
   - App manifest with metadata
   - Service worker for offline functionality
   - Apple-specific meta tags
   - Icon placeholders (need actual PNG files)

4. **Native iOS Support**:
   - iOS project structure via Capacitor
   - Splash screen configuration
   - Status bar styling

### üì± App Store Deployment Steps

#### Prerequisites Needed:
1. **Apple Developer Account** ($99/year)
2. **macOS computer** with Xcode installed
3. **App icons** in PNG format (192x192, 512x512)

#### Deployment Process:

1. **Generate App Icons**:
   ```bash
   # Create PNG icons from your logo
   # Required sizes: 192x192, 512x512, 1024x1024
   ```

2. **Build for iOS**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npx cap add ios
   npx cap sync ios
   npx cap open ios
   ```

3. **Configure in Xcode**:
   - Set app icons
   - Configure app permissions
   - Set deployment target (iOS 13+)
   - Configure signing & certificates

4. **Submit to App Store**:
   - Archive the app in Xcode
   - Upload to App Store Connect
   - Fill out app metadata
   - Submit for review

### üåê Current Benefits

**Single Codebase Serves Both:**
- **Web Version**: Users access via browser
- **Native App**: Submitted to App Store with native features

**Features Ready for App Store:**
- Native navigation
- Offline capability
- Push notifications (when implemented)
- Native sharing
- Deep linking support

### üöÄ Immediate Next Steps

1. **Create app icons** (hire designer or use tool like Figma)
2. **Purchase Apple Developer account**
3. **Set up development environment** (macOS + Xcode)
4. **Generate test build** to verify functionality

### üìä Recommendation

This hybrid approach gives you:
- **Fast deployment** (single codebase)
- **Lower maintenance** (one app, two platforms)  
- **Native features** when needed
- **Web accessibility** for broader reach
