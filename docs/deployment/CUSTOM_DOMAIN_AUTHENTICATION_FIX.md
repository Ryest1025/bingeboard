# Custom Domain Authentication Fix

## ISSUE IDENTIFIED

The custom domain `www.joinbingeboard.com` is configured but not fully functional due to SSL certificate issues. Users are still accessing via the Replit domain, causing daily authentication failures.

## IMMEDIATE SOLUTION

Instead of adding the Replit domain to Firebase (which would need daily updates), we should force users to use the custom domain for authentication.

## CURRENT STATUS

- ✅ Custom domain configured: `www.joinbingeboard.com`
- ✅ REPLIT_DOMAINS set correctly: `www.joinbingeboard.com`
- ❌ SSL certificate not yet active
- ❌ Users still accessing via Replit domain

## PERMANENT FIX OPTIONS

### Option 1: Wait for SSL Certificate
- The SSL certificate for `www.joinbingeboard.com` should generate automatically
- Once active, users can access via `https://www.joinbingeboard.com`
- This eliminates daily domain changes permanently

### Option 2: Force Custom Domain Redirect
- Add redirect logic to force users to `www.joinbingeboard.com`
- This ensures authentication always uses the stable domain
- Works even during SSL certificate generation

### Option 3: Update Firebase for Custom Domain
- Add `www.joinbingeboard.com` to Firebase authorized domains
- This is the permanent solution we implemented yesterday
- Should work once SSL certificate is active

## RECOMMENDED ACTION

1. **Check SSL Certificate Status**: Verify if `www.joinbingeboard.com` SSL is active
2. **Test Custom Domain**: Try accessing `https://www.joinbingeboard.com` directly
3. **If SSL Active**: Direct users to use custom domain only
4. **If SSL Pending**: Implement temporary redirect to custom domain

## WHY THIS SOLVES THE PROBLEM

- Custom domains don't change daily like Replit domains
- Once `www.joinbingeboard.com` is fully functional, no more daily OAuth updates needed
- Authentication will work consistently on both mobile and desktop
- This is the permanent solution we designed yesterday

The key is getting users to access via the custom domain instead of the Replit domain.
