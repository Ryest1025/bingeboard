# Custom Domain Routing Fix

## Problem Identified
- Custom domain (www.joinbingeboard.com) routes to Replit's default "Run this app" page
- DNS is working correctly (CNAME record configured)
- Server is configured for custom domain
- Need to route custom domain traffic to running Express server

## Solution Required
The custom domain needs to be configured in Replit to route to the running application port (5000).

## Steps to Fix

### Option 1: Replit Domain Configuration
1. Go to Replit project settings
2. Find "Custom Domains" section
3. Add www.joinbingeboard.com to point to running server
4. Configure port routing to Express server (port 5000)

### Option 2: DNS Update
Update CNAME record to point to the specific server endpoint:
- Current: points to base Replit domain
- Needed: points to running application port

### Option 3: Server Configuration
Update server to handle custom domain routing properly by ensuring it binds to correct interface.

## Current Status
✅ DNS CNAME configured correctly
✅ Server running on port 5000
✅ OAuth callbacks configured
⚠️ Custom domain shows Replit default page instead of app
→ Need to route custom domain traffic to Express server

## Test URLs
- Original Replit domain: Should work for testing
- Custom domain: www.joinbingeboard.com (needs routing fix)

The authentication system is ready - just need proper traffic routing.
