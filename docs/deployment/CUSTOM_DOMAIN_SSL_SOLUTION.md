# Custom Domain SSL Certificate Solution

## Current Issue
The custom domain www.joinbingeboard.com shows "Your connection is not private" error with `net::ERR_CERT_COMMON_NAME_INVALID` because Replit doesn't provide SSL certificates for custom domains.

## Immediate Workaround
1. **Click "Advanced" in the browser warning**
2. **Click "Proceed to www.joinbingeboard.com (unsafe)"**
3. The app will load correctly with HTTP instead of HTTPS

## Permanent Solutions

### Option 1: Replit Deployments (Recommended)
1. Deploy the app using Replit Deployments
2. Replit Deployments provide SSL certificates for custom domains
3. Follow deployment guide in `docs/deployment/REPLIT_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`

### Option 2: Cloudflare SSL Proxy
1. Set up Cloudflare account
2. Add joinbingeboard.com to Cloudflare
3. Configure DNS through Cloudflare
4. Enable SSL/TLS encryption
5. Cloudflare will provide SSL certificate

### Option 3: Use Replit Domain Temporarily
Access the app directly at the Replit domain (secure):
- Check console logs for actual Replit domain
- Use that domain until custom SSL is configured

## Current Status
- DNS is working (domain resolves)
- App server is running correctly
- Only SSL certificate is missing
- App functions normally after bypassing SSL warning

## Next Steps
1. Try accessing with SSL warning bypass
2. If app loads, authentication should work
3. Plan permanent SSL solution for production
