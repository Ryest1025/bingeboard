# Custom Domain Routing Solution

## Root Cause Identified
The custom domain www.joinbingeboard.com is reaching Replit but not being routed to the Express server running on port 5000.

## Immediate Solution Required
You need to configure the custom domain in your Replit project settings:

### Steps to Fix in Replit Dashboard:

1. **Go to your Replit project**
   - Open your BingeBoard project in Replit

2. **Access Project Settings**
   - Look for "Settings" or "Deployments" section
   - Find "Custom Domains" or "Domain Configuration"

3. **Add Custom Domain**
   - Add: `www.joinbingeboard.com`
   - Point to: Running application (port 5000)
   - Enable: HTTP/HTTPS routing

4. **Alternative: Use Replit's Domain Service**
   - Go to "Deploy" tab in Replit
   - Look for "Custom Domain" settings
   - Add www.joinbingeboard.com
   - Configure it to route to your running app

## Current Status
✅ DNS CNAME record configured correctly in Wix
✅ Server configured for custom domain (REPLIT_DOMAINS set)
✅ OAuth callbacks configured for custom domain
✅ Express server running on port 5000
⚠️ Custom domain needs Replit-side configuration

## What's Working
- Server authentication system is permanently fixed
- OAuth callbacks are correctly configured
- Custom domain DNS is properly set up

## What's Missing
- Replit project needs to be configured to route www.joinbingeboard.com traffic to the running Express server

## Manual Configuration Required
This requires you to access your Replit project settings and configure the custom domain routing. The DNS is working - just need the Replit side setup.

Once configured, authentication will work permanently at www.joinbingeboard.com without daily domain changes.
