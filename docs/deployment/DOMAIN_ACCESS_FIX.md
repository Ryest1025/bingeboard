# Domain Access Issue

## Problem
- `joinbingeboard.com` (root) gives privacy error
- Only `www.joinbingeboard.com` has the CNAME record

## Solution
You need to access the **www** subdomain:

### Try These URLs:
1. `http://www.joinbingeboard.com` (HTTP with www)
2. `https://www.joinbingeboard.com` (HTTPS with www - may show security warning initially)

### Why This Happens
- CNAME record points **www.joinbingeboard.com** to Replit
- Root domain (`joinbingeboard.com`) doesn't have DNS configuration
- Need to use www subdomain until SSL certificate generates

### What's Working
✅ Server configured for www.joinbingeboard.com  
✅ OAuth callbacks set for www subdomain  
✅ DNS routing for www subdomain  
⏳ SSL certificate generating for www subdomain  

### Test Steps
1. Visit `http://www.joinbingeboard.com` 
2. Should load BingeBoard app
3. Test Google/Facebook login
4. Authentication will work permanently

The custom domain solution is working - just need to use the www subdomain!
