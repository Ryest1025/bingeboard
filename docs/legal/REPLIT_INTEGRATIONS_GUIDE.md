# Replit Domain Configuration Steps

## Found the Right Location!
You need to click on the **"Integrations"** tab - this is where custom domain settings are typically located.

## Steps to Configure:

### 1. Click "Integrations" Tab
- This should show available integrations and services

### 2. Look for Domain Services
In Integrations, look for:
- **Custom Domains**
- **Domain Configuration**
- **External Domains**
- **Hosting Settings**
- **SSL/HTTPS Settings**

### 3. Add Your Domain
Once you find the domain section:
- Add: `www.joinbingeboard.com`
- Configure it to point to your running application
- Enable HTTPS/SSL if available

### 4. Alternative: Preview Tab
If Integrations doesn't have domains, try the **"Preview"** tab:
- This might show deployment/hosting options
- Look for domain configuration there

## What You're Looking For
Any section that allows you to:
- Add external domains
- Configure custom domains
- Set up HTTPS redirects
- Route domains to your app

## Current Status
- Your app is running and accessible via the original Replit domain
- DNS is configured correctly
- Just need to tell Replit to route www.joinbingeboard.com to your app

Click on **Integrations** first and let me know what options you see!
