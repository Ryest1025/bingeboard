## Current Active Pages:
- `../Discover.tsx` - Main discover page with aggregated API, SSR prefetch, and modern UI
- `../friends-discovery.tsx` - Friends-specific discovery page

- `modern-discover.tsx` - Modern discover variant

## Migration Notes:
- All functionality from these pages has been consolidated into the new `Discover.tsx`
- The new page uses the unified `/api/discover` endpoint for better performance
