# Quick Recovery Guide

## If You Need Auth Working ASAP Tomorrow:

### Option 1: Use the Working Backup
1. Copy `WORKING_BACKUP_LANDING.tsx` to `client/src/pages/landing.tsx`
2. This removes Firebase complexity and uses simple email auth
3. Should work immediately with your existing server

### Option 2: Test Firebase Issues
1. Open `firebase-social-test.html` in browser
2. Click "Test Firebase Config" first
3. Look for specific error messages
4. Report what step fails

### Option 3: Restore from Git
```bash
git log --oneline | head -10
# Find commit when auth was working
git checkout [commit-hash] -- client/src/pages/landing.tsx
```

## Server Status Check
Your server should still be running. If not:
```bash
cd server
npm start
```

## Critical Files
- `AUTHENTICATION_PROGRESS.md` - Full session notes
- `WORKING_BACKUP_LANDING.tsx` - Simple auth fallback
- `firebase-social-test.html` - Firebase diagnostic tool

## Tomorrow's First Steps
1. Test the backup landing page
2. Check server logs for auth errors  
3. Verify Firebase Console settings
4. Focus on getting ONE login method working first

Good luck! The TMDB integration is solid, just need to fix auth.
