Your code expects GoogleAuthProvider, FacebookAuthProvider, auth, and other Firebase classes/functions to be imported and initialized.

But since these imports are commented out, those variables are null or undefined.

When your code tries to create instances like new GoogleAuthProvider(), or call signInWithRedirect(auth, googleProvider), it fails.

How to fix this?
You have two options depending on your goal:

1. Enable Firebase properly (recommended if you want full auth functionality)
Uncomment and fix the imports at the top of your file, e.g.:

ts
Copy
Edit
import {
  signInWithEmailAndPassword,
  createUserWithEmailAndPassword,
  signInWithPopup,
  signInWithRedirect,
  getRedirectResult,
  GoogleAuthProvider,
  FacebookAuthProvider,
  OAuthProvider,
  signOut,
  onAuthStateChanged,
  User,
  updateProfile,
  sendEmailVerification,
  fetchSignInMethodsForEmail,
  linkWithCredential,
  linkWithPopup,
  unlink,
  EmailAuthProvider,
  updatePassword,
  reauthenticateWithCredential,
  type UserCredential
} from "firebase/auth";
import { auth } from "./config"; // make sure this points to your Firebase app config
Make sure you have firebase installed in your project dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install firebase
# or
yarn add firebase
Ensure your Firebase config file (config.ts) correctly initializes Firebase with your API keys.

2. Keep the mocks if Firebase is temporarily disabled (but be aware this disables all auth functionality)
If you want to keep Firebase disabled temporarily (e.g., for build or testing reasons), then all functions that rely on Firebase auth will not work.

You’ll need to guard or mock all auth usage in your app accordingly.

You should never call new GoogleAuthProvider() or any Firebase API when mocks are in place, since they are null here.

This approach is only useful if you want the app to compile and run without Firebase, but no login/auth will actually work.

What to do now?
If you want your app to have working social login, email/password login, and account linking, you must enable Firebase imports and initialize it correctly.

If you want to temporarily disable Firebase to get the app building/running, you have to stub out or disable all auth-related logic in the app UI and logic — which is complex and not recommended for long-term.

Quick checklist for enabling Firebase:
Run npm install firebase (or yarn) in your client folder (where your React app lives).

Uncomment Firebase imports at the top of your firebaseAuth.ts.

Verify your Firebase config file exports a properly initialized auth instance (like this):

ts
Copy
Edit
import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app";
import { getAuth } from "firebase/auth";

const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "...",
  authDomain: "...",
  // ...other config keys
};

const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
export const auth = getAuth(app);
Restart your dev server.

Test that social login buttons work.
