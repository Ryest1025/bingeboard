# Authentication Progress Report

## Current Status (Session End)
- **Issue**: Both social login (Google/Facebook) AND email login stopped working
- **Time Spent**: Several hours debugging Firebase authentication
- **Critical**: Complete authentication system failure

## What We've Done Today
1. ✅ Fixed TMDB API endpoints (trending, search, discover all working)
2. ✅ Added comprehensive TMDB routes to server
3. ✅ Created Firebase diagnostic test files
4. ✅ Simplified Firebase configuration (removed problematic overrides)
5. ❌ Social login still not working despite multiple attempts
6. ❌ Email login now also broken (was working before)

## Files Modified Today
- `client/src/pages/landing.tsx` - Multiple Firebase auth attempts
- `server/routes.ts` - Added complete TMDB API routes
- `firebase-social-test.html` - Enhanced diagnostic test file
- `firebase-diagnostic.html` - Configuration validation tool

## Known Working Components
- ✅ Server running on port 5000
- ✅ TMDB API integration fully functional
- ✅ Firebase Console properly configured
- ✅ Session management working
- ✅ Basic app structure intact

## Critical Issues to Fix Tomorrow
1. **Email Login Broken** - Primary authentication method not working
2. **Social Login Failing** - Google/Facebook authentication stuck/hanging
3. **Firebase Integration** - Possible configuration or code-level issues

## Next Steps (Priority Order)
1. **URGENT**: Restore email login functionality
2. Fix Firebase authentication initialization
3. Test social login with working email login as baseline
4. Verify popup blockers and browser security settings
5. Consider Firebase Auth domain configuration

## Backup Files Created
- `firebase-social-test.html` - Enhanced diagnostic tool with timeouts
- `firebase-diagnostic.html` - Configuration validator

## Server Status
- Backend is running and functional
- All TMDB endpoints working (200 responses)
- Authentication routes exist but client-side auth is broken

## Firebase Configuration (Current)
```javascript
const firebaseConfig = {
    apiKey: "AIzaSyB45zr8b2HjIx1fzXOuQsHxeQK9wl_wC88",
    authDomain: "bingeboard-73c5f.firebaseapp.com",
    projectId: "bingeboard-73c5f",
    storageBucket: "bingeboard-73c5f.firebasestorage.app",
    messagingSenderId: "145846820194",
    appId: "1:145846820194:web:047efd7a8e59b36944a03b"
};
```

## Working Theory
- Firebase authentication module loading or initialization issue
- Possible conflict between email and social auth implementations
- May need to revert to a known working state

## Recommended Tomorrow Actions
1. Check git history for last working authentication state
2. Test `firebase-social-test.html` to isolate Firebase issues
3. Focus on email login first (simpler to debug)
4. Consider creating minimal auth implementation
5. Verify Firebase Console settings match code configuration
