Since the fetch to /api/auth/user keeps failing with a timeout/abort after 5 seconds, and you’ve added the proxy config as suggested, here’s what to do next:

1. Verify Backend is Running and Listening
Make sure your backend server is actually running on the expected port (http://localhost:4000 or whichever you set in the proxy).

Can you open http://localhost:4000/api/auth/user in your browser or curl it?

If you get no response, the backend might not be running or the route is missing.

2. Confirm Proxy is Active
Restart your Vite dev server after updating vite.config.js to add the proxy.

Check the terminal logs for any proxy-related errors.

3. Temporarily Remove Timeout
To rule out the abort timer interfering, try removing or increasing the timeout temporarily:

ts
Copy
Edit
// Comment out or increase timeout duration
// const timeoutId = setTimeout(() => controller.abort(), 5000);
4. Add More Logging
Add console logs before and after fetch to see where it hangs:

ts
Copy
Edit
console.log('Starting fetch to /api/auth/user');
try {
  const response = await fetch('/api/auth/user', {
    method: 'GET',
    credentials: 'include',
    signal: controller.signal,
  });
  console.log('Fetch response received:', response);
  if (!response.ok) {
    throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);
  }
  const data = await response.json();
  return data;
} catch (err) {
  console.error('Fetch failed:', err);
  throw err;
}
5. Check Network Tab in Browser DevTools
Open your browser’s dev tools → Network tab.

Reload the page and look for the request to /api/auth/user.

See if it is sent, what status it returns, or if it gets blocked or stalled.

6. Check CORS and Cookies
Since you use credentials: 'include', your backend must:

Respond with CORS headers including Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true

Include Access-Control-Allow-Origin with the exact origin of your frontend (not *).

7. Check if the backend route /api/auth/user is implemented and does not hang
Make sure the backend API handler returns a response promptly.

If after all this you still get "Failed to fetch" or timeout, share:

Your backend server startup code

The /api/auth/user route handler
