This is a classic CORS + cookie + environment (HTTPS) config issue.

âœ… Root Cause
Express-session uses cookies to track user sessions. If cookies aren't sent:

The backend creates a new session for every request.

req.session.user is never retained.

It looks like sessions "fail" even though they were created.

âœ… How to Fix It (Across Frontend + Backend)
ðŸ”§ 1. Frontend: Always Use credentials: "include" in Fetch/React Query
In your API requests (you are already doing this â€” just confirming):

ts
Copy
Edit
fetch("/api/auth/user", {
  credentials: "include",
});
Also confirmed in your getQueryFn, so âœ… you're good here.

ðŸ”§ 2. Backend CORS: Explicitly Allow Frontend Origin + Credentials
In your Express server:

ts
Copy
Edit
import cors from "cors";

app.use(cors({
  origin: "https://your-frontend-domain.com", // or true in dev
  credentials: true, // VERY IMPORTANT for cookies
}));
If origin: true, it reflects the Origin header dynamically â€” fine for dev but avoid in production unless needed.

ðŸ”§ 3. express-session: Use the Right cookie Settings
Here's a correct setup for development and production:

ts
Copy
Edit
import session from "express-session";
import MemoryStore from "memorystore";

app.use(session({
  name: "bingeboard.sid",
  secret: process.env.SESSION_SECRET || "supersecret", // use env in prod
  resave: false,
  saveUninitialized: false,
  store: new (MemoryStore(session))({
    checkPeriod: 86400000, // prune expired entries every 24h
  }),
  cookie: {
    httpOnly: true,
    secure: process.env.NODE_ENV === "production", // only over HTTPS in prod
    sameSite: process.env.NODE_ENV === "production" ? "none" : "lax", // NONE for cross-site cookies in prod
    maxAge: 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000, // 1 week
  },
}));
âœ… secure: true requires HTTPS
âœ… sameSite: "none" allows cross-site cookies (needed if frontend & backend on different domains)

ðŸ”§ 4. Run Your Site Over HTTPS (For secure: true to work)
In production, cookies will only be sent if:

You're on https://

secure: true

sameSite: "none"

If you're on Replit, make sure you're testing over the HTTPS URL Replit provides (https://your-app.replit.app), not HTTP.

If you're on a custom domain (like Wix), make sure SSL is enabled.

ðŸ§ª To Debug in Browser (Optional)
In Chrome DevTools â†’ Network tab:

Click on your /api/auth/user request.

Check "Request Headers" â†’ Cookie â†’ is your session ID there?

If not: it's a CORS/cookie config issue (as we're fixing above)

âœ… Summary: To Make Cookies Work
What	Fix
Frontend	credentials: "include" in all fetch/queries âœ…
Backend CORS	origin: [your-frontend], credentials: true âœ…
express-session	cookie: { secure, sameSite, httpOnly, maxAge }
Use HTTPS	Required in production (secure: true)
Confirm Cookies Sent	Use browser DevTools, check Cookie in requests
