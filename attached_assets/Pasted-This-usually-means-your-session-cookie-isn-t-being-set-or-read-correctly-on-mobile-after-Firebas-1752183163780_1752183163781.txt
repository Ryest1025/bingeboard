### **Checklist to Fix Mobile Login Loop**

1. **Backend Cookie Settings**
   - Set your session cookie with these flags:
     ```
     Set-Cookie: session=...; Path=/; Secure; SameSite=None
     ```
   - This is required for cross-origin and mobile browsers.

2. **Frontend Fetch**
   - Always use `credentials: 'include'` in fetch requests to your backend.

3. **Test Cookie in Mobile Browser**
   - After login, open browser dev tools (if possible) and check if the session cookie is present.
   - If not, the backend isn’t setting it correctly.

4. **Check `/api/auth/user` Endpoint**
   - Make sure this endpoint returns the user if the session cookie is valid.
   - If it returns 401/unauthenticated, the cookie isn’t being sent or read.

5. **Redirect Only After Session Is Set**
   - After login, wait for `/api/auth/user` to return a valid user before redirecting.

**Summary:**  
- The issue is almost always cookie settings or session creation on the backend.
- Fix your backend to set cookies with `Secure` and `SameSite=None`.
- Use `credentials: 'include'` in all frontend fetches.
- Test and confirm the cookie is present after login.
