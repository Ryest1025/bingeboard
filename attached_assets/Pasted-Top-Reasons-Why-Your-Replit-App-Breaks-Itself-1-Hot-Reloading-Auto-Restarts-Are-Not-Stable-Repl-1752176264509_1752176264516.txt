Top Reasons Why Your Replit App “Breaks Itself”
1. Hot Reloading & Auto Restarts Are Not Stable
Replit may automatically restart the server, rebuild, or reload dependencies — even if you didn’t change code.

This can happen after being idle overnight.

If your build is not reproducible (e.g. depends on runtime-only values or uncommitted code), it can fail silently.

2. Dependencies Aren’t Locked or Persisted Reliably
If you're missing a package-lock.json, or your node_modules isn’t cached, Replit may reinstall packages inconsistently on each restart.

This causes mismatches like:

Firebase SDK missing

Wrong version of React

Random Vite or plugin errors

✅ Fix: Always commit a package-lock.json and avoid Replit’s “Run without install” behavior.

3. Your Dev/Prod Logic Isn’t Isolated Cleanly
Replit might be running in “dev” or “prod” inconsistently based on environment variables.

If you have logic like this:

ts
Copy
Edit
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === "production") {
  // Different auth/session/route behavior
}
But NODE_ENV isn’t set or changes, your app will behave differently on each boot.

✅ Fix: Explicitly set NODE_ENV in your .env file or Replit Secrets.

4. State (like Firebase Sessions) Gets Lost
Session cookies might expire or get dropped by the browser or Replit’s proxy.

Firebase Auth may require you to call getRedirectResult() on every load, but your redirect handler might be broken or skipped.

When the session fails to restore, your app treats the user as logged out and goes into a refresh loop.

✅ Fix: Build your auth flow to gracefully handle session loss and always re-check Firebase on page load.

5. The Code Editor or Git Sync Isn’t Fully Saving
You might change files and see it work, but Replit fails to persist changes if:

You didn’t click "Commit to Git"

You have multiple tabs open

The build cache was wiped after a crash

✅ Fix: Commit important working changes and download a local backup.

6. Vite Plugin Glitches
The [plugin:runtime-error-plugin] error you saw can come back if:

You hot-reload while a request is in-flight

Vite doesn't clear state properly

You import something like firebase/auth before it's installed

✅ Fix: Fully stop + restart the server after big changes, don’t rely on hot reload alone.

✅ How to Prevent These Breakages
✅ Action	💡 Why It Helps
Commit a package-lock.json	Locks all dependency versions
Always call getRedirectResult() on login redirect pages	Completes Firebase login
Set NODE_ENV=development explicitly in .env	Ensures consistent behavior
Handle missing sessions gracefully in useAuth()	Prevents crashes and loops
Restart Replit manually before testing	Clears corrupted state
Consider exporting the app to Railway or Vercel	More reliable builds
