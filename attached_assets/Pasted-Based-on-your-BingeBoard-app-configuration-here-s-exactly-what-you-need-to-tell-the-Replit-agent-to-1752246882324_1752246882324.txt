Based on your BingeBoard app configuration, here's exactly what you need to tell the Replit agent to fix the mobile app issue:

## **Tell the Replit Agent:**

"My BingeBoard app loads on web but not on mobile. I need help setting up the required environment variables and Firebase configuration for mobile compatibility. Here's what needs to be done:

### **1. Add these Secrets in Replit's Secrets tab:**

```
FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key_here
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_firebase_project_id_here
FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_firebase_app_id_here
FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_firebase_messaging_sender_id_here
FIREBASE_ADMIN_KEY=your_firebase_admin_service_account_json_here
SESSION_SECRET=your_random_32_character_session_secret_here
TMDB_API_KEY=your_tmdb_api_key_here
```

### **2. Enable PostgreSQL database:**
Make sure the .replit file includes `postgresql-16` in the modules section (it should already be there).

### **3. Firebase Console Setup:**
I need to add these domains to my Firebase project's authorized domains:
- `https://[my-repl-name].[my-username].repl.co`
- `https://[my-repl-name].[my-username].replit.dev`

### **4. The specific issue:**
The app works on desktop but fails on mobile browsers. The error is likely related to:
- Missing Firebase configuration
- CORS issues with mobile browsers
- Session cookies not working on mobile
- Database connection problems

### **5. Files already configured for Replit:**
- .env file uses Replit environment variable syntax
- index.ts has CORS configured for `.repl.co` domains
- auth.ts has mobile-friendly session settings
- db.ts supports both `REPLIT_DB_URL` and external database

Can you help me:
1. Set up the Firebase project and get the required API keys?
2. Add all the secrets to Replit's environment?
3. Test the mobile functionality?
4. Debug any remaining mobile-specific issues?"

## **Additional Context for the Agent:**

"This is a React + TypeScript app with:
- Firebase authentication
- PostgreSQL database (using Replit's built-in or Neon)
- Express.js backend
- Mobile-responsive design that should work on phones

The main issue is that mobile browsers can't authenticate or load the app properly, while desktop browsers work fine."

This gives the Replit agent all the specific information they need to help you configure the environment variables, set up Firebase, and debug the mobile compatibility issues.
