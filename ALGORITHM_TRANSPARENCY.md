# 🔍 BingeBoard Recommendation Engine - Algorithm Transparency

## Overview

This document provides complete transparency into how BingeBoard's recommendation algorithms work, ensuring users understand how content suggestions are generated and scored.

## 🧮 Algorithm Architecture

### Multi-Algorithm Hybrid System

BingeBoard uses a weighted combination of multiple algorithms:

1. **Content-Based Filtering** (30-40% weight)
2. **Collaborative Filtering** (25-35% weight)  
3. **Social Recommendations** (15-25% weight)
4. **Trending/Popularity** (10-20% weight)
5. **Contextual Factors** (5-15% weight)

The exact weights are dynamically adjusted based on:
- User profile maturity (new vs. established users)
- Available data quality
- Real-time performance metrics

## 📊 Candidate Generation Pipeline

### Phase 1: Content Pool Assembly

```
1. User Preference Matching
   ├── Favorite Genres (Score: 0.3-0.5)
   ├── Preferred Runtime (Score: 0.1-0.3)
   ├── Language Preferences (Score: 0.2-0.4)
   └── Content Type (Movie/TV) (Score: 0.1-0.2)

2. Behavioral Pattern Matching
   ├── Previously Watched Similar Content (Score: 0.4-0.6)
   ├── Watchlist Items (Score: 0.5-0.7)
   ├── Rated Content Similarity (Score: 0.3-0.5)
   └── Completion Rate Correlation (Score: 0.2-0.4)

3. Social Layer
   ├── Friends' Recommendations (Score: 0.3-0.6)
   ├── Popular in Network (Score: 0.2-0.4)
   └── Community Ratings (Score: 0.1-0.3)

4. Trending Layer
   ├── Global Trending (Score: 0.1-0.3)
   ├── Genre-Specific Trending (Score: 0.2-0.4)
   └── New Releases (Score: 0.1-0.2)
```

### Phase 2: Content Filtering

- **Availability Filter**: Only streaming-available content
- **Quality Filter**: Minimum rating thresholds
- **Recency Filter**: Avoid recently watched content
- **Diversity Filter**: Ensure genre/type variety

## 🔢 Scoring Methodology

### Base Score Calculation

Each recommendation receives a composite score:

```typescript
finalScore = (
  contentBasedScore * contentWeight +
  collaborativeScore * collaborativeWeight +
  socialScore * socialWeight +
  trendingScore * trendingWeight +
  contextualBonus
) * diversityMultiplier * freshnessFactor
```

### Individual Algorithm Scores

#### 1. Content-Based Scoring

```typescript
contentScore = (
  genreSimilarity * 0.35 +
  directorActorMatch * 0.25 +
  runtimePreference * 0.15 +
  yearPreference * 0.10 +
  languageMatch * 0.15
)
```

**Factors Explained:**
- **Genre Similarity**: Cosine similarity between user's genre preferences and content genres
- **Director/Actor Match**: Overlap with user's favorite creators/actors
- **Runtime Preference**: How well content length matches user patterns
- **Year Preference**: Alignment with user's preferred content era
- **Language Match**: Native language and subtitle preferences

#### 2. Collaborative Filtering Scoring

```typescript
collaborativeScore = (
  userSimilarityRating * neighborhoodPreference +
  itemBasedSimilarity * contentCorrelation
) * confidenceLevel
```

**Factors Explained:**
- **User Similarity**: Users with similar taste patterns
- **Item Similarity**: Content liked by users with similar preferences
- **Confidence Level**: Statistical confidence in predictions

#### 3. Social Scoring

```typescript
socialScore = (
  friendRecommendations * 0.4 +
  networkPopularity * 0.3 +
  communityRatings * 0.3
) * socialInfluenceFactor
```

#### 4. Trending Scoring

```typescript
trendingScore = (
  globalTrending * 0.3 +
  genreTrending * 0.4 +
  newReleases * 0.3
) * trendSensitivity
```

### Contextual Bonuses

Additional score modifications based on context:

- **Time of Day**: +0.1 to +0.3 based on historical viewing patterns
- **Day of Week**: +0.05 to +0.15 for weekend vs. weekday preferences
- **Device Type**: +0.1 to +0.2 for device-optimized content
- **Season/Weather**: +0.05 to +0.25 for seasonal content
- **Mood/Activity**: +0.1 to +0.3 based on explicit or inferred context

## 🎯 Personalization Factors

### User Profile Building

The system builds comprehensive user profiles including:

```
Personal Preferences:
├── Explicit (User-provided)
│   ├── Favorite Genres
│   ├── Preferred Languages
│   ├── Content Type Preferences
│   └── Runtime Preferences
├── Implicit (Behavioral)
│   ├── Viewing Completion Rates
│   ├── Rating Patterns
│   ├── Search Behaviors
│   └── Browsing Patterns
└── Contextual (Environmental)
    ├── Viewing Times
    ├── Device Usage
    ├── Social Interactions
    └── Seasonal Patterns
```

### Learning Mechanisms

1. **Explicit Feedback**
   - Star ratings (1-5 scale)
   - Thumbs up/down
   - Watchlist additions
   - Direct preferences

2. **Implicit Feedback**
   - Watch completion rates
   - Skip/fast-forward patterns
   - Pause/resume behaviors
   - Search-to-watch conversion

3. **Temporal Learning**
   - Time-of-day preferences
   - Seasonal viewing patterns
   - Binge vs. casual viewing
   - Device-specific behaviors

## 🎚️ Dynamic Weight Adjustment

Algorithm weights are continuously adjusted based on:

### User Lifecycle Stage

```
New Users (< 10 interactions):
├── Content-Based: 50%
├── Trending: 30%
├── Collaborative: 15%
└── Social: 5%

Established Users (10-100 interactions):
├── Content-Based: 35%
├── Collaborative: 35%
├── Social: 20%
└── Trending: 10%

Power Users (> 100 interactions):
├── Collaborative: 40%
├── Content-Based: 30%
├── Social: 20%
└── Trending: 10%
```

### Performance Metrics

Weights adjust based on real-time performance:
- Click-through rates
- Watch completion rates
- User satisfaction scores
- Engagement metrics

## 🔄 Real-Time Adaptation

### Session-Based Learning

Within a single session, the system adapts by:
1. **Immediate Feedback Integration**: Real-time score adjustments
2. **Context Awareness**: Time, device, and activity considerations

### Feedback Loop

```
User Interaction → Immediate Score Update → Profile Update → 
Algorithm Weight Adjustment → Next Recommendation
```

## 🚫 Bias Prevention & Fairness

### Diversity Mechanisms

1. **Genre Diversity**: Ensures variety across recommendation sets
2. **Temporal Diversity**: Mixes old and new content
3. **Popularity Diversity**: Balances mainstream and niche content
4. **Creator Diversity**: Promotes diverse voices and perspectives

### Filter Bubbles Prevention
