# üîß STEP-BY-STEP MOBILE ACCESS FIX

## üìç **NEW SERVER RUNNING ON PORT 8080**

Your app is now running on port **8080** which should work better for mobile access.

## üéØ **STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS:**

### STEP 1: Find the Ports Panel
- **Look at the BOTTOM of your VS Code window**
- **You should see tabs like: PROBLEMS | OUTPUT | TERMINAL | DEBUG | PORTS**
- **Click on "PORTS"**

### STEP 2: Make Port 8080 Public
In the Ports panel, you should see:
```
Port | Running Process | Local Address | Visibility
8080 | npm run dev    | localhost:8080| Private
```

- **Right-click on the row with port 8080**
- **Select "Port Visibility"**
- **Choose "Public"**
- **The Visibility should change to "Public"**

### STEP 3: Get Your Mobile URL
After making it public, you should see a globe icon üåê or the URL will change to:
```
https://fuzzy-xylophone-5g97jqp4vq9wf4jjr-8080.app.github.dev
```

### STEP 4: Test on Your Phone
Open your phone browser and go to:
```
https://fuzzy-xylophone-5g97jqp4vq9wf4jjr-8080.app.github.dev
```

## üö® **IF YOU DON'T SEE THE PORTS TAB:**

### Alternative Method:
1. **Press Ctrl+Shift+P** (Command Palette)
2. **Type "ports"**
3. **Select "Ports: Focus on Ports View"**
4. **This will open the Ports panel**

### Or Use Command Palette:
1. **Press Ctrl+Shift+P**
2. **Type "forward port"**
3. **Select "Forward a Port"**
4. **Enter "8080"**
5. **Choose "Public"**

## üì± **WHAT TO EXPECT:**

### If It Works:

## üîó **YOUR NEW MOBILE URLS:**
